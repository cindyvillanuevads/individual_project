#### PROJECT PLANNIG

- Acquire data from  using my own function to automate this process. this function is saved in acquire.py file to import into the Final Report Notebook.
- Clean and prepare data for preparation step. Create a function to automate the process. The function is saved in a prepare.py module. Use the function in Final Report Notebook.
- Define two hypotheses, set an alpha, run the statistical tests needed,document findings and takeaways.
- Establish a baseline accuracy and document well.
- Train  models.
- Evaluate models on train and validate datasets.
- Choose the model that performs the best.
- Evaluate the best model (only one) on the test dataset
